AISF is welcoming 40 students from all over the world for the third edition of Particle and Astroparticle Physics Autumn Program (PAPAP17)
A four days journey from the endlessly small to the endlessly big.
The event will be held in central Italy, between the cities of Rome and Lâ€™Aquila from the 9th to the 13th October, 2017. We will visit some cutting-edge facilities in particle and astroparticle physics such as the underground Gran Sasso National Laboratories and the Frascati National Laboratories.
