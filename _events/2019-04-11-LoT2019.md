The Lights of Tuscany programme, now at its third edition, is organised by the Italian Association of Physics Students and is open to all members of the International Association of Physics Students. The event will bring 40 students to visit some of the most advanced research facilities in Europe, with a focus on Photonics and Optics and one key mission: to foster enthusiasm in the minds of young physicists.
