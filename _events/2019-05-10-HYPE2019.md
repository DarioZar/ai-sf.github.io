HYPE–HistorY and Physics Experience–is a three day seminar jointly organised by the International Students of History Association (ISHA) and the Italian Association of Physics Students (AISF), the National Committee for Italy of the International Association of Physics Students (IAPS). This year, HYPE will take place in Rome, gathering together 40 international students from the fields of History and Physics to examine the history and technical underpinnings of Space exploration, “Space” Physics, Space politics, and ponder what may lie beyond the stars.
